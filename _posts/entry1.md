Today I watched my favorite team (Tennessee Titans) in the NFL go to battle. I thought they would be good enough to take down the Houston Texans with their quarterback out, but it just doesn't seem like our season. The talent shows up some weeks and then others we flame out like a bucket of water was spilled on us. I know we're in a good spot for the future so I don't mind this loss as it gives us a higher draft pick. We will soon recapture our thrown at the top of the AFC South.
